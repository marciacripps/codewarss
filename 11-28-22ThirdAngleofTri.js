/*You are given two interior angles (in degrees) of a triangle.

Write a function to return the 3rd.

Note: only positive integers will be tested.

function otherAngle(a, b) {
    return 180-a-b 
  }
  
  //p - two numbers a, b only positive and interior angle numbers 
  //r - third number for a triangle knowing its   180-a-b
  //e - (30, 60) 90
  //p - return 180-a-b
